# Project-2

This project was to redesign the ITMD-362 Class website.
I partnered up with two classmates, Viktor and Erick to do this project.
I worked primarily on collapsible content sections for the website to organize the content on it pages.

The main take aways for me are:
- Small changes like making content organized can dramatically improve the experience of the website.
- In my case, adding a collapsible content section reduced the amount of scrolling needed on the site by a lot.
- However, I could have added some interactiveness like icon and animation to indicate to user that the grey tabs are collapsible sections.
