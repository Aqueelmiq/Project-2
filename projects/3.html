                    <p>
                        The final project of the course asks you to subject your group’s redesign
                        project to a series of low-stakes user tests, and to suggest improvements to the
                        website, based on what you learn through your user tests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book. You are
                        welcome to use as a starting point his sample script and recording release
                        form available <a href="http://www.sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">at Krug’s
                        website</a>. However, your script must be modified to match your specific project and
                        tasks, obviously.

                            Test your site with three different participants <b>not</b> in our class. At least one
                            participant should use a mobile device (phone or tablet); at least one should use a

                            When possible, have participants use their own devices (but have a backup device ready

                        <li>
                            Figure out how to best involve online students in your group who cannot be present on
                            campus for testing; include those details in your site plan
